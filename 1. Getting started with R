# Packages in R -----------------------------------------------------------

# Detailed instructions are given in the presentation "1 Installing & Getting started with R.ppt"

# To use any library/package in R, you need to first install it (once) 
# and then load it (for every session).
# For every R session, you need to load the required library again

# To see all packages installed
library() 
#To see packages currently loaded
search() 
#To install a package ‘caret’
install.packages(“caret”, dependencies=TRUE)
#To load a package ‘caret’
library(caret) # Note: there is no ""
#To  discover the contents of library package ‘caret’
library(help=caret)

# install package from zip file
install.packages("D:/Downloads/accrued_1.4.1.zip", repos = NULL)

# To view the full list of the contents of a library
objects(grep("spatial",search()))  

# To unload a package without having to restart R 
detach("package:spatial", unload=TRUE)
detach_package(spatial) # Alternate way
detach_package("spatial", TRUE) # Alternate way

unloadNamespace("sqldf") # detaches the namespace prior to unloading it


# Working Directory in R --------------------------------------------------

# To check the current working directory
getwd()
# To set a new working directory
setwd("D:\\Learning\\Learn R\\R_programming data and codes")
Note: use '\\' or '/' in the path of directory
# The shortcut (to get/change the current working directory) 
"ctr+shift+h“ 


# To get help in R --------------------------------------------------------

# There are various options to get help in R, some of these are:

# Click on the 'Help' menu

# To invoke a built-in help browser 
help.start()

# To get help on some specific command
?keyword
help(keyword)
# For example
?is.null      # To get help on the function 'is.null'
help(is.null); ?is.null() # ALternate ways

# To get help on a subject, if precise command is not knnown
help.search("data input") # To get help on a subject 'data input', for example

# To check what package something is in, using 'find' function
find("lowess"); find("pairs") 

# If you are not sure of the command 
apropos("mean")
apropos("wd")
# It returns a character vector giving the names of all objects 
# in the search list that match our (potentially partial) enquiry


## To find some function from all packages (not necessarily installed)
# If you want to look through packages that you have not necessarily installed, 
# you could try using the findFn function in the sos package. 

# This function searches the help pages of packages covered by the RSiteSearch archives 
# (which includes all packages on CRAN)

library(sos); findFn("white.test")


# First source to get online help is http://cran.r-project.org/


# Sample Problems in R ----------------------------------------------------

## Worked Examples of Functions 

# To see a worked example (lm represents linear models)
example(lm) 

## Demonstrations of R Functions

# To see the range of things R can do
demo(graphics) # To Show some demo graphs generated with R
demo(persp)
demo(Hershey)
demo(plotmath)


# To import data in R -----------------------------------------------------


# Detailed instructions are given in the presentation "1 Installing & Getting started with R.ppt"
# Make sure to set your working directory


#To import Text data file in R
myTEXTdata=read.table("mydata.txt“, header = TRUE)
  
#To import CSV data file in R

myCSVdata <- read.table("c:/mydata.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", row.names="id")

# Note: the '/' instead of '\' on Windows systems
myCSVdata = read.csv("mydata.csv")


## NOTE: Read.csv is identical to read.table with the only difference 
# that in Read.csv() the default separator is comma while in read.table() it's space.

#To unzip a file (saved in current working directory and read)
src.file <- unz("diet_data.zip", "diet_data/Andy.csv")
x = read.csv("diet_data/Andy.csv")
x

# To download zip file from web and unzip it before reading a file from it
download.file(dataset_url, "diet_data.zip")
unzip("diet_data.zip", exdir = "diet_data")
andy <- read.csv("diet_data/Andy.csv")


# to install perl for read.xls
installXLSXsupport(perl = 'C:\\strawberry\\perl\\bin\\perl.exe') 

# To load excel file in xlsx or csv format using the package "xlsx" 
# FIrstly install package "xlsx" and perl then load it with library() and finally read it
library(xlsx)
help(read.table)
data <- read.xls("hw1_data R programming.xlsx") # To load excel file from the working directory
data <- read.xls("abc.xlsx", sheetName = "sheet1", header = T) # To specify sheet number & include headers
data1 = read.csv("hw1_data R programming.csv")


## To import data, if the name and location of the file is unknown

# reading a csv file, if the name and location of the file is unknown
mydata <- read.csv(choose.files())

# reading an excel file, if the name and location of the file is unknown
mydata <- read.xlsx(choose.files())

# reading a file with a table structure (& separated by tab), if the name and location of the file is unknown
library(xlsx); mydata <- read.table(choose.files(), sep = "\t")

# reading a SPSS file, if the name and location of the file is unknown
library(foreign); mydata <- read.spss(choose.files())

## To look at available data sets in R
data()

# To load available data set
data(mtcars) # It will load in built dataset named 'mtcars'
mtcars # Alternate way

# To get help data description
help(mtcars)

# To view data set
View(mtcars) # Note: View is different from view

# To edit data set 
edit(mtcars) # Open data editor
fix(mtcars) # ALternate way

# For data frame/ matrix data objects they are shown in a spread sheet 
# while list is shown in notepad

# Data editor can also be accessed from the menu bar by selecting Edit/Data editor (in command line interface)


# To export data from R, similar functions write.csv, write.table etc can be used
# For more details, refer "1 Installing & Getting started with R" 
# Other useful tips -------------------------------------------------------


# To Change the Look of the R Screen
# The Rgui Configuration Editor under Edit/GUI preferences (in command line interface)

# Disappearing Graphics in R
par(ask=TRUE) # To stop multiple graphs whizzing by
# to specify the number of seconds delay between each action, use the Sys.sleep function

# Good Housekeeping

x=5 
y=7

# To see variables created in the current session
objects() 
# To see libraries and objects attached
search() 

# Linking to Other Computer Languages
# Functions .Call and .External provide interfaces which allow compiled code (primarily compiled C code) to manipulate R objects.

# Tidying Up (at the end of R session)

detach(data.frame.name) # To detach any data frame attached earlier in the session
detach(mtcars)
# NOTE: detach command does not make the dataframe disappear; it just means that 
# the variables within this data frame, are no longer accessible directly by name.

rm(x, y, z) # To remove (rm) any variables names (x, y, z) created in the current session
## To see all the objects saved and to delete some/all of them
# The ls() function allows us to look at a list of all of the objects that we have saved so far.
# The rm() function can be used to delete any that we don’t want.

x <-5; y <- x+2; z <--3
ls(); rm(x); ls()

rm(list=ls()) # To get rid of everything, including all the dataframes

## To save file (encoding option)
# UTF-8 is superset of all encoding options, its better to make it default option to save files 
q() # To quit the current R session



## To check version of R
version

## To upgrade to a latest version of R
install.packages("installr") # install 
setInternet2(TRUE) # saves some troubles
library(installr)
installr::updateR() # updating R.
# If there is any issue; Try to run R in administrator mode.
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/how-do-i-run-an-application-once-with-a-full-administrator-access-token
# Locate the program icon or a shortcut in Windows Explorer.
# Right-click the program icon or shortcut, and then click Run as administrator.
