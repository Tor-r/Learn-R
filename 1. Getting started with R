## TO GET HELP IN R

# To get help on the function, if function name is known
?is.null      # To get help on the function is.null, for example
help(is.null)

is.null(x) returns TRUE if its argument is NULL and FALSE otherwise.
as.null(x) ignores its argument and returns the value NULL. 

# To get help on a subject, if precise function name is not knnown
help.search("data input") # To get help on a subject 'data input', for example

# First source to get online help is http://cran.r-project.org/

## Worked Examples of Functions

example(lm) # To see a worked example (lm represents linear models)

## Demonstrations of R Functions

# To see the range of things R can do
demo(graphics) # To Show some demo graphs generated with R
demo(persp)
demo(Hershey)
demo(plotmath)

# Libraries in R
library(spatial) # To load the library spatial 

# Contents of Libraries
library(help=spatial) # To use the help function to discover the contents of library package 'spatial'

objects(grep("spatial",search()))  # To view the full list of the contents of a library

# To install Packages and Libraries
install.packages("akima")
install.packages("chron")

# Data Editor in R
# It can be accessed from the menu bar by selecting Edit/Data editor (in command line interface)
fix(data.frame.name) # Alternate way to edit data in the data frame/matrix

# To import data from Excel (saved in a tab-delimited text file), use the function called read.table

## NOTE: Read.csv is identical to read.table with the only difference 
# that in Read.csv() the default separator is comma while in read.table() it's space.

# To unzip a file (saved in current working directory and read)
src.file <- unz("diet_data.zip", "diet_data/Andy.csv")
x = read.csv("diet_data/Andy.csv")
x

# To download zip file from web and unzip it before reading a file from it
download.file(dataset_url, "diet_data.zip")
unzip("diet_data.zip", exdir = "diet_data")
andy <- read.csv("diet_data/Andy.csv")


data2 = read.table("hw1_data R programming.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",",fileEncoding='UCS-2LE')
# read.table is not working

# to install perl for read.xls
installXLSXsupport(perl = 'C:\\strawberry\\perl\\bin\\perl.exe') 

# To load excel file in xlsx or csv format using the package "xlsx" 
# FIrstly install package "xlsx" and perl then load it with library() and finally read it
library(xlsx)
help(read.table)
data <- read.xls("hw1_data R programming.xlsx")
data1 = read.csv("hw1_data R programming.csv")

# To check the current working directory
getwd()
# To set a new working directory. Note: use '\\' or '/' in the path of directory
setwd("D:\\NISHA\\R Coursera\\R_programming")
# The shortcut (to get and change the current working directory) is press - "ctr+shift+h" 

search()      # To see all the packages that are currently loaded in R

# To Change the Look of the R Screen
# The Rgui Configuration Editor under Edit/GUI preferences (in command line interface)

# Disappearing Graphics in R
par(ask=TRUE) # To stop multiple graphs whizzing by
# to specify the number of seconds delay between each action, use the Sys.sleep function

# Good Housekeeping

x=5 
y=7

objects() # To see variables created in the current session
search() # To see libraries and dataframes attached

# Linking to Other Computer Languages
# Functions .Call and .External provide interfaces which allow compiled code (primarily compiled C code) to manipulate R objects.

# Tidying Up (at the end of R session)

rm(x, y, z) # To remove (rm) any variables names (x, y, z) created in the current session
detach(data.frame.name) # To detach any data frame attached earlier in the session
detach(mtcars)
# NOTE: detach command does not make the dataframe disappear; it just means that 
# the variables within this data frame, are no longer accessible directly by name.

rm(list=ls()) # To get rid of everything, including all the dataframes

## To save file (encoding option)
# UTF-8 is superset of all encoding options, its better to make it default option to save files 
q() # To quit the current R session

## To see all the objects saved and to delete some/all of them
# The ls() function allows us to look at a list of all of the objects that we have saved so far.
# The rm() function can be used to delete any that we donâ€™t want.
x <-5; y <- x+2; z <--3
ls(); rm(x); ls(); rm(list=ls())
